#+TITLE: Collaboration Preferences (ligon)
#+AUTHOR: Metrics Miscellany Maintainers
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

These notes capture Ethan (“ligon”)’s working style inside *Metrics_Miscellany* so that
human and automated collaborators can stay aligned.  Update this document as preferences
evolve.

* Tooling Defaults
- Use **Poetry-managed commands**; avoid =pip install= in the global interpreter.
- Default to =make quick-check= during development.  Pass =FILES=path/to/file.py= if you
  need a narrower run.
- Re-run the relevant Make target after each fix and narrate the
  *check → diagnose → repair → re-check* cycle in status notes.
- Prefer Org-mode edits over direct Python changes; keep the tangled Python output synced.

* Git Workflow
- Create dedicated branches for feature work and *commit early and often*.
- Keep commits scoped (docs vs. code vs. tooling) and reference verification commands in the
  commit message body when helpful.
- Push once the branch passes =make quick-check= (and =make slow-tests= if slow cases change).

* Documentation Style
- Stick to American spelling (vectorize, linearize) in prose.
- Use \[ ... \] or \begin{equation} ... \end{equation} delimiters for display math; avoid
  bare Unicode symbols.
- Summarize estimator behaviour and index conventions when touching =metrics_miscellany.org=.

* Communication
- Surface blockers immediately (missing dependency, sandbox limit, failing tangle) along with
  a proposed remediation.
- Leave breadcrumbs in =docs/automation/status_log.org= (or a dated sibling) when a session
  introduces decisions worth remembering.
- The prompt *“remember the maxim”* is a cue to revisit this file and confirm the current
  workflow is being followed.

Feel free to add dated appendices (e.g., “<2025-10-27 Mon> Added preference for Poetry quick-check”).
