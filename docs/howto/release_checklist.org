#+TITLE: Release Preparation Checklist

#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

Use this checklist when preparing a tagged release of *Metrics_Miscellany*.

* Dependency Review
- Ensure [[https://github.com/ligon/DataMat][DataMat]] has a released version that satisfies =pyproject.toml=; update the
  path or version specifier accordingly.
- If a local editable install was used during development (=make use-local-datamat=),
  run =poetry install --sync= to return the virtualenv to the published PyPI build.
- Bump other pinned minimums (e.g., =statsmodels=, =pandas=) if the release relies on
  newer functionality.

* Documentation Refresh
- Update [[file:../../README.org][README.org]] with new highlights or API changes.
- Record notable changes in =CHANGES.txt= (or draft notes in =docs/automation/= if
  preparing a longer announcement).
- Verify that =docs/index.org= lists any new guides.

* Quality Gates
#+begin_src bash
make quick-check
make slow-tests   # only if slow tests exist / were modified
#+end_src
- If tangles changed, re-run =./tangle.sh metrics_miscellany.org= and confirm =git status=
  is clean afterwards.

* Build Artifacts
#+begin_src bash
poetry build
#+end_src
- Optionally install the wheel in a fresh virtualenv to smoke-test importability.

* Version & Tag
- Update the =version= field in =pyproject.toml= and any version references in the Org
  sources or README.
- Commit with a message like “Bump version to vX.Y.Z” and tag the release:
  #+begin_src bash
  git tag vX.Y.Z
  git push --follow-tags
  #+end_src

* Publish & Announce
- Upload artifacts via =poetry publish= or manual =twine= upload if required.
- Announce the release in the usual channels and note any follow-up tasks or known issues.
