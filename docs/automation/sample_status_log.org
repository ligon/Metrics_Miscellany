* Session Summary
- Date: <2025-10-27 Mon>
- Task: Example run documenting lint/test commands.
- Agent: ExampleAssistant v1

* Status Notes
1. Confirmed repository standards via =docs/index.org= and =AGENTS.org=.
2. Ran =make quick-check= (ruff, black --check, mypy, pytest -m "not slow").
3. Recorded timing for =poetry run pytest= to help future automation estimate runtime.

* Verification Commands
- =make quick-check=
- =poetry run pytest -m slow  # only if required=

* Outstanding Questions
- Should automation logs live in a single rolling file (=status_log.org=) or one per session?
- Do we want to capture wheel build results in these logs?
